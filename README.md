# EDA-on-BigQuery-Google-Analytics
Analyzing Google Analytics data from BigQuery using SQL.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on BigQuery with Google Analytics is a process that involves leveraging Google BigQuery, a cloud-based data warehouse, to perform comprehensive analysis of data collected from Google Analytics. This integration allows for the exploration of vast amounts of data and the extraction of meaningful insights. The process begins with integrating Google Analytics data with BigQuery using the Export feature, ensuring that the most up-to-date data is available for analysis. Once the data is in BigQuery, SQL queries can be used to explore the dataset, extracting relevant metrics, dimensions, and events. Data cleaning and transformation techniques are applied to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address any anomalies or outliers. The next step involves conducting exploratory data analysis, using statistical techniques, visualizations, and data exploration methods to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Descriptive analysis is performed to gain insights into user behavior, traffic sources, conversions, and other key analytics data. The final stage involves visualizing the analyzed data using tools like Google Data Studio or Tableau, creating reports and dashboards that effectively communicate the findings, recommendations, and actionable insights to stakeholders. Overall, EDA-on-BigQuery-Google-Analytics provides businesses with a powerful means of understanding their website performance, user engagement, and marketing campaigns, enabling data-driven decision-making and optimization of strategies.
